A rust implementation for a p2p data sharing for the nodes live on the same network.

This rust code provides logs in the command line to enable the peer-to-peer live text editing function. It relays the cursor position of editing peer to other peers live on the same network.

To enable the communication and collaboration between the peers in the network we are using libp2p rust implementation.

This repository is still work in progress.
The readme will be updated parallelly to the project updates.
